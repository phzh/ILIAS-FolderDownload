DO NOT DELETE THIS FOLDER!

It's used as dummy folder for specifying a version to the script that new versions are
loaded immediately from the browser instead taking the version from the cache.
The version appended by ILIAS doesn't work in that case, it should be the one of the plugin.

JavaScript file link looks like:
./[dir_to_plugins]/FolderDownload/js/1-1-0/../ilFolderDownload.js

PHP's is_file() on windows works as expected even if the folder does not exist but unfortunatelly 
Linux needs that the "dummy version" folder exists else is_file() returns false.
